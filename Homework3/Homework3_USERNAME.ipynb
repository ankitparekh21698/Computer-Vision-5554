Each matrix contains N two-dimensional points. For each value of i, src[i] and dst[i] are corresponding points from two different images.

You can set up the problem in a matrix-based, least-squares format. (A somewhat similar problem is in the lecture slides on page 15 of packet 9.) Helpful functions are `np.linalg.eig()` and `np.linalg.eigh()` for computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The latter function will prevent warnings due to small imaginary values if you are working with matrices that are real and symmetric. \n","2.   **apply_homography(src, H)** receives points in matrix named src (an Nx2 matrix), and a homography transformation H (a 3x3 matrix). This function should use the homography matrix to transform each point in src to a new destination point. Store the resulting points in matrix dst, which is the same size as src.
