You are allowed to use a thresholding operation (with hard-coded threshold values) along with other techniques, if needed. \n","\n","Here are the required actions/outputs of the program:\n","\n","1) Create and display a new image that has the same row-and-column size as `image1.png`. In the new image, there should be only 2 pixel values: *white* and *black*. Ideally, every *white* pixel in your new image should correspond to a pixel in `image1.png` that shows an unpainted portion of the soccer field; and all other pixels in your new image should be *black*.\n","\n","2) Compute and print a count of white pixels in your new image. Use a Python instruction similar to the following to report your answer:\n","\n","`print (f'Number of white pixels = {count}')`\n","\n","For full credit, your output does not need to be completely perfect. It is expected that a few grassy pixels will not be detected correctly, and it is expected that a few non-grass pixels will be incorrectly detected as grass. To give you an idea of the expected output, the image below is a small, cropped portion of a good result. (Your function must process the entire input image, not just the small part that is shown here.) Dark pixels are associated with the person and with the paint stripe in the input image. Notice that a few white pixels have been placed incorrectly on the person. There are very few cases of black pixels on the unpainted part of the playing field.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"PMe3PaLX0zV5"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","![crop white download (15).png](data:image/png;base64,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)\n","\n","---\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"fHn9yl12bpaf"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Write your function in the code block below."],"metadata":{"id":"Q7XeVsgjcHce"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def mainFunction():\n","  ''' TO DO: implement this function as described in the text blocks above.\n","  '''\n","  print(\"In function mainFunction\")\n","  \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","  return"],"metadata":{"id":"uUH1-EQSokNa"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9UxfWFuffadY"},"source":["#Running your code\n","\n","The grader should only need to run **`mainFunction()`** in the next block in order to run your code and see the required output.
